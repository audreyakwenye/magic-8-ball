
If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
"Ah, you're part of something way bigger"
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no


Understand that truth about that question in your soul
"Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold"
"Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print"
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
"Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'"
"No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice"


"Let Mama let you know (Let you know)Mama's still tryin'I can't get no days offI don't get no days offTruly, I'm feelin' itI had to say that thing twice (Twice)"
"Tryin' to be a good wifeStill really hard, I can't lieBut I promised you I would fight, so I fight"
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
"You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)"
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
"You'll never lose, we are winners"
"I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree"
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
"Legacy, ah"
We're part of something way bigger
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
(Yeah) Bigger
You're part of something way bigger
"Bigger than you, bigger than we"
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
"Legacy, oh"
You're part of something way bigger


Let love be the waterI pour into you and you pour into meThere ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise


You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
"Bigger than you, bigger than me"
"Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah"
"Ooh, ooh, ooh"
You're part of something way bigger

Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
"Daddy used to take my hand, say, ""Follow me"""
Daddy used to lead me back home all the time
"I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside"


"He said, ""Find your way back"
"Big, big world, but you got it, baby"
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
"Find your way back"""

"Circle of life, and one day, I might not make itCircle of life, and one day, I might not make it"""


"""But you just gotta find your way back"
"Big, big world, but you got it, baby"
Find your way back

Find your way back
"Find your way back"""
[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Daddy used to teach me all my moves
"Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes"
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
"Wild, wild child, look a lot like you"
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
"Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix"
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
"On a marathon, have to run my race"

"One time, I took a swim in the NileI swam the whole way, I didn't turn aroundMan, I swearIt made me relax when I came downI felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated nowPlunging away 'less my body's on topAll of these currents might cost me my life right nowWhen danger finds me, it follows with tidesMany miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride"
She said


"Hey little buddy, where you goin'?"
"I'm not sure, but I know I'm still in motion"
"This ain't regular, I seen regular"
These streams may take me out to the ocean


Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking
"Waistline on four deep, senses on four deep"
Feel like there's four me



"Got the Nile runnin' through my bodyLook at my natural, I'm so exotic"
"Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit"
"Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots"
"Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it"
"Fountain of Youth, I said I'm drowning in it"


"I'm in the Nile, deep in denialI'm in the Nile, deep in denial"
That's some good

"I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me"
"Tick, tick, wait on it"
I'm keepin' down my body count
"I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah"
Cause every day above ground is a blessing
"I done leveled up, now my view panoramic"
None of my fears can go where I'm headed
"Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levee, yeah"
"I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner"
"The rain and thunder gon' pourGo Mutumbo, no, no sinner"
You can't dim my light


Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
"The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah"
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
"Together, we big timin'"
Don't make me have to remind you
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I got my cup up to the heavensAnother night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
I promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever


Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up


"Forever, and ever-ever, and ever-ever (Yeah, yeah)"
"At the Saxon Madiba suite (Yeah, yeah) like Mandela"
"Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos (My daughter)"
"Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)That's a billi', a thousand milli' (Ugh)First one to see a B out these housing buildings"
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (Ow)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Forever and ever
"Ever, forever"
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now


All praise due
My enemies still pressed
Cannot lose
Cause I bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
"Now, I move better, ooh"
Energy pourin' out
I feel a change comin' now
"Royalty in my blood from the kingdomThe more money, more problems season"
But don't you let that get you out your way
Rise up higher
"Jump, jump and don't look down"
You're so far from the ground
"Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh"


I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
Forever and ever

"I'd never trade you for anybody else, singin'"
Brown skin girl
Your skin just like pearls
The best thing in the world
"I'd never trade you for anybody else, singin'"


She said she really grew up poor like me
Don't believe in nothin' but the Almighty
Just a likkle jeans and a pure white tee
"She never dream for ever be nobody wifey, yeah"
"She Wilhelmina pretty, but she heart is a maze"
Play ya like a villain 'cause she caught in a wave
"Tonight, I am walkin' away"
"Nine-to-five mind, on the grind, yeah, yeah"


"Tonight, I might fall in love"
Dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calming down
Can't let no one come control me
Keep dancing and call it love
"She fights it, but falling slowly"
If ever you are in doubt
Remember what Mama told me
[Chorus: Wizkid]
Brown skin girl
Ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world

Pose like a trophy when Naomi's walkin'
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin
Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in
Drip broke the levee when my Kellys roll in
"I think tonight, she might braid her braids"
Melanin too dark to throw her shade (Shade)
She minds her business and wines her waist
"Gold like 24K, okay"


"Tonight, I might fall in love"
Dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calming down
Can't let no one come control me
Keep dancing and call it love
"She fights it, but falling slowly"
If ever you are in doubt
Remember what Mama told me
